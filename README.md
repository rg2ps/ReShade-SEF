## ReShade Real-Time Simulated Exposure Fusion


Simulated Exposure Fusion - is an image processing technology that allows adaptive local adjustment of dynamic range and local adjustment of exposure based on image content.
This implementation attempts to use the exposure fusion principles from the original paper (https://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2019/279/) but adapts them for real-time usage for any game or scene.
